# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Using import math function,do the calculations.
### Step 2: 
Take input of the coordinates as x1 , y1, x2, y2
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: 
Using the print function, display the distance between the two points.
### Step 5: 
End the program.
### PROGRAM:
```python
d = ((4-10)**2)+((2-6)**2)
ans = d**0.5
print(f"{ans:.2f}")
```
### OUTPUT:
